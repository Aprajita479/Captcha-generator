# Captcha Generator

This is a simple Captcha generator implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It generates a random text string consisting of capital letters, small letters, and numbers, and displays it on a canvas. The user needs to enter the text correctly in order to pass the Captcha validation.

## Getting Started

To use the Captcha generator in your own project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Include the following files in your HTML:

   - `index.html`: The HTML file containing the structure and layout of the Captcha generator.
   - `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the visual styles for the Captcha generator.
   - `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the logic and functionality of the Captcha generator.

3. Make sure to have an internet connection to load the necessary external resources, such as Font Awesome Icons and Google Fonts.

4. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser, and you should see the Captcha generator in action.

## Usage

The Captcha generator provides a simple user interface with the following elements:

- Canvas: The canvas element where the Captcha text is displayed.
- Reload button: Clicking this button generates a new random Captcha text and updates it on the canvas.
- User input: An input field where the user needs to enter the text shown in the Captcha image.
- Submit button: Clicking this button checks if the user input matches the generated Captcha text. If it matches, an alert with "Success" is shown. Otherwise, an alert with "Incorrect" is displayed, and a new Captcha is generated.

Feel free to integrate the Captcha generator into your own forms or applications to add an additional layer of security against automated bots.

If you want to customize the appearance or behavior of the Captcha generator, you can modify the CSS styles in the `style.css` file and the JavaScript logic in the `script.js` file. The provided code serves as a starting point, and you can extend it according to your requirements.
